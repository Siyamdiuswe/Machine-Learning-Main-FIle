to choose no of cluster we can use wcss = (+distance(p,c1))^2+ (+distance(p,c2))^2+ (+distance(p,c3))^2
p = point 
c = cluster
wcss = within-cluster sum of squares 
wcss >minimum = good result   But it can be 0 which is super bad so we have to use *elbow method

To avoid random initilization trap we can use kmeans ++ in the algorithm
